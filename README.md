# AiShop Demo

A small, interactive demonstration showcasing how client-side WebAI can be seamlessly integrated into an e-commerce product listing page. This project specifically demonstrates how natural language prompts from a user can be interpreted by a lightweight AI model running in the browser, which then triggers predefined heuristics (simple JavaScript functions) to dynamically filter, sort, or highlight products on the page, mimicking the behavior of an intelligent AI agent.
